# CSS Animations

Animation in web design has been around for a long while. They first became popular thanks to the .gif format, and later, .swf. However, with a lot of designs not factoring in usability, animation soon became associated with poor UX.

### Tool for extra help
1. waitanimate
CSS doesn't provide an easy way to pause an animation before it loops around again. Yes, there's animation-delay but this simply denotes a delay at the very start of the animation, i.e on load. WAIT! Animate provides an easy way to calculate the keyframe percentages so that you can insert a delay between each animation iteration. Below are some example animations to demonstrate how this is achieved. Below that is a config tool to add waits to your own animations without the need for JavaScript.
