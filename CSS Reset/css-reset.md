# CSS Reset

A CSS Reset is a set of styles that overwrite user agent styles, making the default styles as consistent as possible across all browsers.

The simplest reset that you can apply is by setting all elements to have zero padding, margin, border as shown below.

```CSS
* {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	border: 0;
}

```

A much more elaborate way would be as shown below

article, aside, details, figcaption, figure,
footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section {
	display: block;
}
body {
	line-height: 1;
}
ol, ul {
	list-style: none;
}
blockquote, q {
	quotes: none;
}
blockquote:before, blockquote:after,
q:before, q:after {
	content: '';
	content: none;
}
table {
	border-collapse: collapse;
	border-spacing: 0;
}

```

By using a CSS Reset, you must add a few default styles back into your own CSS, because they are almost certainly required, but that is a small task when you consider how much easier it is to begin with consistent styles across all browsers.
