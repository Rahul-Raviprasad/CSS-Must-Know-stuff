* Increase horizontal & vertical space between sections (ie; text blocks, cards).
* Increase line-height of paragraphs.
* Control use of accent colors in terms of frequency & proximity to other colors.
* Keep contrasting borders & lines to a minimum.
* Establish must-have vs. extra info (content), and then show/hide accordingly.
* Try to simplify, or prioritize calls to action.
* Consider size & scale of everything, including must-have vs. extra content.
