# Fluid, fixed width and Responsive Pages

## Fluid early days

In the early days of web pages, structure types tended to be fluid, meaning a web page stretched and resized as the browser did to always fill the viewport. This is where the “fluid” name comes from: It fills every area of the web page regardless of its size, just like a fluid fills its container.

A web page, by default, is fluid. The reason is that the initial value for an element’s width is auto, which tells the browser to work out the width itself, based on the unused space around that element. Without any CSS applied to a page—other than the user agent stylesheet— width: auto is the equivalent of width: 100%.

## Fixed Width for more control

If a fluid page stretched depending on the browser win- dow size, designers would have a difficult job designing a web page because they couldn’t be sure how that page would look to the users. The majority of the web started making use of the fixed-width layout
## Responsive design

With new technologies such as CSS3 and HTML5, and in particular the CSS3 media queries, the web is moving toward responsive layouts that start with a fluid structure but then change that layout based on the size of a device—something that couldn’t be done when fluid layouts were first in use.
