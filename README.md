## The Role of CSS

The main purpose of CSS is to separate structure (HTML) from presentation (CSS).

By separating structure and presentation, you gain numerous advantages:
• A Cascading Style Sheet can be shared across multiple web pages.
• Sites are easier to maintain and become more flexible.
• The styles applied to a web page can be tailored to suit multiple devices/environments.
